<!-- infuser start description -->
This library is based on the brilliant Callbag spec by Andr√© Staltz, which allows creating both pullable and listenable streams from simple functions. That makes it lightweight and flexible and that's why it shines when used as a primitive for libraries or apps!

## Use

```typescript
import { pipe, interval, tap, map, filter, forEach } from 'reactive-fns'

pipe(
  interval(1000),
  tap((v) => console.log('Before: ' + v)),
  map((x) => x * 3),
  filter((x) => x % 2 === 0),
  forEach((v) => console.log('After: ' + v))
)
```

### Source Creators

- fromEvent: Listen to DOM event.
- fromIter: Convert an Iterable or Iterator to a pullable stream (only send data when requested).
- fromPromise: Converts a promise to a stream.
- interval: Emits an increasing number at given intervals.
- of: Convert static value(s) to a stream.

### Operators

- debounce: Debounces incoming values.
- filter: Filters incoming values.
- flatten: Flattens higher-order streams.
- map: Transforms incoming values.
- mapTo: Transforms the contents of the stream to the provided value.
- sample: Operator that samples a pullable stream when a listenable stream emits.
- scan: Combine consecutive values from stream.
- share: Multicast stream.
- skip: Ignores the first n of the stream.
- skipRepeats: Skips consecutive values that pass the given predicate (defaults to a === b).
- startWith: Start with given values.
- take: Take a maximum number of values from stream.
- withPrevious: Puts the previous value with current in an array.

### Combinators

- concat: Combine streams by putting one stream after the previous stream ends.
- merge: Merges given streams, emitting when each one emits.
- combine: Combines given streams, emits arrays of latest values of each.

### Utilities

- extract: Get the last emitted value if it exists.
- forEach: Subscribes to given stream.
- pipe: Pipes streams to operators to sinks.
- tap: Taps into given stream.
